E-VISTA PROJECT - WORK DISTRIBUTION (4 MEMBERS)
================================================

MEMBER: mem1 - Backend Core & User/Quiz Domain
------------------------------------------------
Primary Ownership (Backend)
- Auth & User Management
  - Implement and maintain authentication flow and middleware (verifyToken).
  - Handle user registration, login, and token-based access control.
  - Own the User model (User.js), including stats and preferences fields.

- Core Application APIs (non-ML business logic)
  - Own user-facing domain routes that orchestrate services but do not implement ML themselves:
    - /api/user/*  (user dashboard, summaries, quiz history, badges exposure)
    - /api/quiz/*  (quiz generation + /submit, working together with Gemini services and Quiz/QuizAttempt models).
    - /api/flashcard (topic/summary-based flashcard generation using Gemini services).
    - /api/chat      (Edu Bot HTTP layer, JWT decoding, persistence in ChatSession/ChatMessage).
  - Ensure these routes call the appropriate service-layer functions and models safely and efficiently.

- User Dashboard & History
  - Own /api/user/dashboard in backend/routes/user.js.
  - Aggregate and return user stats, recentSummaries, recentQuizzes, recentChats, and badges.
  - Ensure recent summaries and quiz attempts are correctly queried and sorted.

- Quiz Domain (Backend)
  - Own quiz-related routes in backend/routes/quiz.js.
  - Implement quiz generation endpoint.
  - Implement /api/quiz/submit to save QuizAttempt, update user stats, and return results.

- Badge & Stats Integration
  - Integrate calls to updateUserStats() wherever needed (summary generation, quiz completion, chat usage).
  - Coordinate with mem2 (who owns badgeService.js) for any changes to stats or badge logic.

- Search & Helper APIs
  - Coordinate implementation of /api/search (unified educational YouTube search) and ensure it uses helper utilities (parseDuration, educational keyword augmentation) consistently.
  - Work with mem2 on any changes in YouTube-related logic that impact downstream analysis.

Secondary Responsibilities
- Review backend-related pull requests from mem2 and mem3 that touch user/quiz APIs.
- Maintain shared middlewares (logging, error handling, basic validation).

================================================

MEMBER: mem2 - AI/ML & Service Layer (Python + Gemini + GPU)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Ownership (ML/Services)
- Whisper Transcription & Audio Processing
  - Own backend/services/whisper_service_simple.py and other Whisper-related components.

- Gemini & Summarization Services
  - Own:
    - backend/services/geminiService.js
    - backend/services/enhancedSummarizer.js
    - backend/services/visualOnlySummarizer.js
    - backend/services/audioAnalyzer.js (if present)

  - Maintain visual analysis and video duration logic:
    - visualAnalyzer.js
    - videoDurationChecker.js
  - Ensure visual-only and enhanced summaries work for various input types.

- Multi-Modal Pipelines & Equation Extraction
  - Design and maintain the core analysis pipelines used by:
    - /api/transcript        (smart transcript + optional visual enrichment for short videos)
    - /api/analyze-video     (complete analysis: audio + visuals + optional equations)
    - /api/equations/*       (frame extraction, equation OCR, transcript timeline merge).
  - Own and evolve the supporting services:
    - equationExtractor.js   (frame_extractor.py, equation_ocr.py, equation_transcript_merger.py bridge).
    - audioAnalyzer.js / audioAnalyzer.py (Librosa-based speech detection).
    - videoDownloader.js and audioExtractorYtDlp.js (yt-dlp + FFmpeg-based media pipeline).
  - Coordinate closely with mem1 so that API responses (summary, equations, merged timeline) stay stable for the frontend and database models.

Secondary Responsibilities
- Write and maintain ML-related documentation (e.g., GPU_ACCELERATION_SETUP.md and ML sections in COMPLETE_PROJECT_EXPLANATION docs).
- Help mem1 with performance investigation when issues come from heavy ML pipelines.

================================================

MEMBER: mem3 - Frontend UI/UX (React)
-------------------------------------
Primary Ownership (Frontend)

================================================

SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES (ALL MEMBERS)
------------------------------------
- Code Reviews
  - Every feature/bugfix PR must be reviewed by at least one other member.
  - Suggested pairing:
    - mem1 ↔ mem3 for user-facing and API integration changes.
    - mem2 ↔ mem4 for ML, performance, and infra-related changes.

- Bug Fix Rotation
  - All members participate in regular bug triage.
  - Bugs are assigned so that no one fixes only their own code; cross-ownership improves code understanding.

- Knowledge Sharing
  - Short internal demos or docs when modifying complex parts:
    - mem2 explains GPU and ML pipelines.
    - mem1 explains stats and badge logic.
    - mem3 explains routing and major UI flows.
    - mem4 explains deployment, testing strategy, and documentation structure.
