  - If deployed, manage CI/CD pipelines and deployment configuration.

- Testing & Quality Assurance
  - Create and maintain API test collections (Postman/Insomnia) for:
    - /api/analyze-video
    - /api/user/dashboard
    - /api/quiz/*
  - Set up and maintain basic automated tests for critical backend logic:
    - updateUserStats behavior.
    - /quiz/submit quiz attempt creation and stats update.
    - /user/dashboard aggregation and history data.
  - Perform manual end-to-end testing of key flows:
    - Video → Summary → Quiz → History.
    - Video → Summary → Listen.
    - ProfilePopup and ProfilePage stats updating in real time.

- Documentation
  - Own and maintain:
    - PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.txt
    - COMPLETE_PROJECT_EXPLANATION.md
    - COMPLETE_PROJECT_EXPLANATION.txt
  - Keep version numbers, recent modifications, and feature descriptions in sync with the implemented code.

Secondary Responsibilities

- Coordinate cross-member code reviews and ensure consistent coding standards.

================================================

SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES (ALL MEMBERS)
------------------------------------
- Code Reviews
  - Every feature/bugfix PR must be reviewed by at least one other member.
  - Suggested pairing:
    - mem1 ↔ mem3 for user-facing and API integration changes.
    - mem2 ↔ mem4 for ML, performance, and infra-related changes.

- Bug Fix Rotation
  - All members participate in regular bug triage.
  - Bugs are assigned so that no one fixes only their own code; cross-ownership improves code understanding.

- Knowledge Sharing
  - Short internal demos or docs when modifying complex parts:
    - mem2 explains GPU and ML pipelines.
    - mem1 explains stats and badge logic.
    - mem3 explains routing and major UI flows.
    - mem4 explains deployment, testing strategy, and documentation structure.
